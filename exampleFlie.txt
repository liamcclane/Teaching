hello this is a file lets add some song lryics 


Taylor Swift Lycis for 
Cow Like Me

[Verse 1]
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, "moo"

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

[Chorus]
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cow like me

According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
