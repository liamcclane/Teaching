hello this is a file lets add some song lryics 


Taylor Swift Lycis for 
CowBoy Like Me

[Verse 1]
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game"

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

[Chorus]
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
